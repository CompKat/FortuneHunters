# FortuneHunters
This is a web game developed for a final project in COMP426 at UNC-CH. 

## Purpose
To play this game, you can either sign up for an account or get started right away. Spend the money you earn in the game
to earn even more money and climb the leaderboard if you are signed in!

## API 
This website features 3 different APIs. One for the "Keep Busy" weather searcher and two for the News button (One HTTPS Encrypted).

## Database
I used a JawsDB MySQL database to manage the data using SQL. This is a free version and may not work if the max size of the database is reached.

### Other Points
* The weather searcher under "Keep Busy" features an autocomplete for your search. 
* Dark mode is implemented and saves in localStorage.

### Extra Features
* Audio button to play a track on repeat.
* Bonus time every 5 minutes, where earnings are doubled for one minute.
